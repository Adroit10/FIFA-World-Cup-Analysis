With millions of followers, the FIFA World Cup is one of the most prestigious and watched sporting events in the world, and I am a huge Football fan. In this analytics project,
I use Power BI visualisation tools and Python programming to mine the extensive FIFA World Cup data collection obtained from Kaggle in an effort to uncover important trends and insights 
to gain a deeper grasp of the tournament's dynamics and historical trends through analysis, which reveals patterns, statistics, and historical trends.
